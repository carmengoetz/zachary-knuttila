      Zachary Knuttila is an emerging artist based in Saskatoon, focusing on digital work
      and traditional printmaking. His work is created as an extension of a personal
      exploration of spirituality and is largely built around a search for the reality
      beyond our human perception. By using digital interfaces to create a framework
      within which the computer creates its own imagery Zachary feels that the direct
      human impulse or intention can be removed from the work allowing a brief vision into
      the reality above our own in line with the gnostic philosophy.
